## ðŸŽ‰ LOGIN ISSUES FIXED!

### âœ… Problem Solved

The login authentication was failing due to **password double-hashing** in the seed data.

**Issue**: The seed script was hashing passwords with bcrypt, then the User model was hashing them again during save, making them invalid for comparison.

**Solution**: Updated seed.js to pass plain text passwords and let the User model handle hashing properly.

### âœ… Demo Credential Auto-Fill Buttons Added

The login page now has convenient buttons to automatically fill in demo credentials:

- **Purple Button**: Admin User (admin@marketplace.com / admin123)
- **Green Button**: Host User (john@electronics.com / host123)
- **Blue Button**: Customer User (alice@customer.com / customer123)

### âœ… Enhanced Error Handling

- Added detailed console logging for debugging login issues
- Improved API error handling with better user feedback
- Fixed hard refresh problems with persistent JWT tokens

### ðŸš€ Everything Working Now!

1. Both servers are running successfully
2. Database is seeded with correct user credentials
3. Login authentication working properly
4. Auto-fill buttons make demo testing super easy
5. Page refreshes no longer break the authentication state

**Ready for full demo! ðŸŽ¯**
